# Algorithms
Repository contains realization of some algorithms wich studied at MIPT on the first three semesters.
  
  
- **[Big Integer](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/1st-sem/biginteger)** - long arithmetics implementation on C++
- **[Deque](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/1st-sem/deque)** - deque implemented by array and two pointers, also contains iterator realization and tests
- **[External algorithms](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/1st-sem/external-algo)** - contains two external algo merge and reverse and little magic with iterators
- **[Mergeable Heaps](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/1st-sem/mergeable-heaps)** - realization of two mergeable heaps known as [Binomial Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_heap) and [Left Skew Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_heap)
- **[Permutation](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/1st-sem/permutation)** - implemented class that represented permutation and contains different operations with it
- **[Tuple](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/2nd-sem/tuple)** - tuple with different elements type on C++ implemented using variadic templates
- **[Xorlist](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/2nd-sem/xorlist-and-allocator)** - realization of list structure linked using xor operation ([XOR linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_linked_list)), also contains allocator and work with lvalue and rvalue
- **[Permutation using Treap](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/2nd-sem/permutation-on-treap)** - different operations with permutation using [treap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap) that improves asymptotics of *next* and *prev* operations to O(nlogn)
- **[Max Flow](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/3rd-sem/max-flow)** - contains solution for olympiad task, used two algorithms for search max flow in graph: [Malhotra, Kumar, Maheshwari algorithm](https://eprints.utas.edu.au/160/1/iplFlow.pdf) (O(V<sup>3</sup>) asymptotics) and [Push-relabel algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%E2%80%93relabel_maximum_flow_algorithm)
- **[Geometry, finding inside points](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/3rd-sem/geometry)** - solution for olympiad task, contains class with geometry enities
