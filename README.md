# Algorithms
Repository contains realization of some algorithms wich studied at MIPT on the first three semesters.
  
  
- **[Big Integer](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/1st-sem/biginteger)** - long arithmetics implementation on C++
- **[Deque](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/1st-sem/deque)** - simple deque implemented by array and two pointers, also contains iterator realization and tests
- **[External algorithms](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/1st-sem/external-algo)** - contains two external algo merge and reverse and little magic with iterators
- **[Mergeable Heaps](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/1st-sem/mergeable-heaps)** - realization of two mergeable heaps known as [Binomial Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_heap) and [Left Skew Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_heap)
- **[Permutation](https://github.com/jullak/mipt-algo/tree/master/1st-sem/permutation)** - implemented class that represented permutation and contains different operations with it
